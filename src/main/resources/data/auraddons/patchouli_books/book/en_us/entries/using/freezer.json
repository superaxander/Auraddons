One such aspect is the fact that water will freeze allowing for the collection of $(item)Ice$() and $(item)Snowballs$(). The $(item)Freezer$() uses $(aura) to bring the cold to warm places. It will cool down all the surrounding blocks. Turning water into $(item)Ice$() and leaving $(item)Snow$() on the ground where it can."
